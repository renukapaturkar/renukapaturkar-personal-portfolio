<em>"Being a developer is not knowing everything there is to know in tech, 
    but it is the confidence to say I will figure it out."

</span>It's Tuesday today. I am here sitting on my chair, writing this article instead of doing office work. 
If you think I have a great job that lets me write in the middle of office hours, you're wrong. 
I have a desk job, 
believe me, it's worse than I thought. So I took a day off out
 of nowhere with my leave balance diminishing with each passing day. 



</p>
<p>
<span class="tab"></span>So for an introduction, I am a CS graduate. I got out of college and 
got a job like every other rgraduate, took 
the job without thinking much. All I was thinking was the financial independence I was about to get. 
I was happy and then  I got assigned to a project. I came to know that, I was in a project 
completely unrelated to what I studied and thought. It was quite depressing to me. 
So I asked around and 
there is no way out of it because of the agreement I made with the organization. I felt stuck. Believe me,
 I put a lot of faith in my luck, turned out that I am completely out of luck. 



</p>

    Coding wasn't much fun in college because there were people around me setting up new records around it, building 
    cool stuff, and getting appreciation for competitive coding while I struggled to get my head around concepts. 
    I gave up on coding because there was no way I'll be that good. 
    <p><span class="tab"></span>
        So when I started my job I realized that I may not all the knowledge in the world about programming but
     I developed a mindset of a programmer over the years. The mindset to figure out things, 
     to create, to make them work. So here I am on my journey to become a developer and hopefully a good one!
